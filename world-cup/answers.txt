Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
Considering that United States actually won, i don't think that any is technically incorret, just less accurate.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
The predictions stabilized after about 10000.
